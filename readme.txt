--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/14
- 1/1 Readme
- 3/3 Basic HTML content
- */3 Basic CSS styling
- */1 Advanced feature
- */3 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    - I have a several photos with alt text.  There is a photo of me and screenshots showing my projects.
    - There are headings for each section and page.  The "About Me" section and guesthouse page both have paragraph text.
    - There is are links to an external website I created with React and to my github repositories.
    - There are multiple pages (for my projects) with navigation between them.
    - I have added custom icons from Font Awesome to create the hamburger menu and close button.
    
(b) CSS features
    - I have modified the margin and padding of the sections and text.
    - I added colors (blue and grey) to the texts, background, and links.  The colors of the links change when the user hovers over them.
    - I have added Roboto Condensed from Google Fonts with the fallback of sans-serif.

(c) Advanced features
    - I have added a navigation bar to easily take users to different parts of the page.  When the screen is smaller, it changes to a hamburger menu that covers the entire screen when clicked.
